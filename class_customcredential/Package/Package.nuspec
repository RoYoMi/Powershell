    <description>This class automates the process storing, accessing, and validating credentials which can be tested against a credential manager like AD.
The idea is that some automation steps might accidently use an old/invalid password which could quickly lock an account if left unchecked.
Using tools like the Microsoft created powershell module for credential management is also a good option, but does require it to be setup and managed.</description>
